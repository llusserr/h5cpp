### [Call The Doctor: string performance measurements, 2021 May 11](http://string-performance.h5cpp.org/)
In Gerd Heber's Call The Doctor event, examined variable and fixed length string write performance of H5CPP and HDF5 CAPI 

### [MeetingC++ Online Tool Fair 2021, Apr 20](http://meetingcpp-toolfair.h5cpp.org/)
In a trade show style online platform H5CPP presented from three overlapping angles. Special thanks to Melissa Kaan for facilitating the event and Gerd Heber for his guest appearance.   

### [C++TO 2020, Jun 30](http://cppto.h5cpp.org/)
Co-presenting with Gerd Heber: H5CPP and current state of reflection in C++

### [Lightning Talk C++TO 2020](http://lightning-talk.h5cpp.org/)
H5CPP in a nutshell

### [ISC'19 BOF](http://isc19.h5cpp.org)
Successful integration with Message Passing Interface and Parallel HDF5 extended the H5CPP template library with 
parallel file system capability. With H5CLUSTER AWS EC2 reference platform we demonstrated both 
**independent** and **collective** IO calls. This addition simplifies persistence in HPC clusters / supercomputers.

### [HDFGroup Webinar](http://webinar.h5cpp.org/)
Influenced by the HDFGroup C++ SIG members a new structured exception handling mechanism added to provide easy catch all, or refined error handling. The new revised internal compile time type system are pure templates, moving away from a low cost but functional macros.
Special thanks to Elena Pourmal for organizing the events, Marc Patterno, Chris Green, from Fermilab, and Eugen Wintersberger from Desy for discussions and feedback.

### [Chicago C++ User Group](http://chicago.h5cpp.org/)
First introduction of H5CPP with help from The HDFGroup leadership, and Gerd Heber to the C++ community took place in Chicago 2018 fall. With the LLVM based compile time reflection H5CPP brought seamless persistence for arbitrary POD types.
